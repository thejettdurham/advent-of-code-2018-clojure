# Advent of Code 2018 - Clojure Style

Solutions for Advent of Code 2018 in Clojure, because why not?

## Usage

If you want to run these yourself, you'll want to have a clojure dev environment with [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

The solutions are designed to be run on the repl directly (usually by running a `partN` function), but they can be run directly via `lein run`

> `lein run -m clj-aoc-2018.dayN`, replace `N` accordingly

If you wish to use your own input, replace `/resources/dayN.txt` accordingly
